        <p>In order to have a result that is more in keeping with the final result, the graphic designers, designers or
            typographers report the Lorem ipsum text in respect of two fundamental aspects, namely readability and
            editorial requirements.
            The choice of font and font size with which Lorem ipsum is reproduced answers to specific needs that go
            beyond the simple and simple filling of spaces dedicated
            to accepting real texts and allowing to have hands an advertising/publishing product, both web and paper,
            true to reality. Its nonsense allows the eye to focus only on the graphic layout objectively evaluating the
            stylistic choices of a project, so it is installed on many graphic programs on many software platforms of
            personal publishing and content management system.
